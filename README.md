📦 Laravel DDD Example

This repository is not intended for production use.
It's a simplified example of how I structured a Laravel project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is for demonstration and educational purposes only.

🧱 What's inside

Modular architecture (e.g. User, Order, etc.)
Clear separation of Domain, Application layers
Use of Laravel features in a DDD-aligned way

💡 Purpose

To showcase how DDD principles can be applied in a Laravel project and serve as a reference or starting point for others exploring this architectural style.
