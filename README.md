üì¶ Laravel Modular Architecture Example

This repository is not intended for production use. It's a simplified example of how I structured a Laravel project using a modular architecture approach, inspired by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This project is for demonstration and educational purposes only.

üß± What's inside

Modular structure (e.g., User, Order, etc.)

Clear separation of concerns across modules

Use of Laravel features in a clean, organized, and scalable way

üí° Purpose

To showcase how a modular architecture can be applied in a Laravel project and serve as a reference or starting point for others exploring this structural style. While not full DDD, the structure encourages domain separation and better organization for growing projects.
